Create a script that either reads standard input or one or more files specified on the command-line.   
Count the number of times and then print a summary, sorted by the count of each entry.  

So with the following input in file example.txt  

apple  
banana  
apple  
cherry   
cherry  
apple  
  
the script would display something like:  
  
apple     3  
cherry    2  
banana    1
